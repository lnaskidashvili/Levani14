Task 3: TLS Communication Inspection & Analysis

1. OpenSSL Connection
----------------------
Website: www.google.com
TLS Version: TLS 1.3
Cipher Suite: TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

Certificate Chain:
- *.google.com (Leaf)
- GTS CA 1C3 (Intermediate)
- GlobalSign Root CA - R1 (Root)

2. Wireshark Analysis
----------------------
Client Hello: Initiates TLS handshake with supported ciphers and extensions.
Server Hello: Responds with selected cipher and certificate.
Certificate: Server identity is verified using public-key infrastructure (PKI).
Key Exchange: Diffie-Hellman key exchange securely shares symmetric key.

3. How TLS Ensures Security
----------------------------
TLS provides:
- Confidentiality: All data is encrypted with symmetric keys negotiated securely.
- Integrity: HMAC ensures message integrity.
- Authentication: Digital certificates verify the server's (and sometimes clientâ€™s) identity.
- Forward Secrecy: Ephemeral keys ensure that even if one key is compromised, past sessions remain secure.


Conclusion:
TLS is the foundation of secure HTTPS communication. It ensures that web traffic is private, authenticated, and tamper-proof.
